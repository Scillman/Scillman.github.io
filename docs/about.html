<h3>Jekyll</h3>
<p>This is a simple GitHub website generated using Jekyll. Which allows the tutorials to
be written completely in Markdown - to be read offline - while providing a staticly generated
website for everyone to read them online.</p>
<h3>About The Content</h3>
<p>The tutorials are all written per version so as to allow modders
to see an accurate example of how to make a mod for their respective version of Minecraft.
As seemingly a lot of questions pop up where the changes between versions of Minecraft
are causing a lot of trouble to new modders.</p>
<h3>Licensing</h3>
<p>The website and its resources fall under <em>Apache License 2.0</em>, the code written
during the tutorials fall under the <em>MIT License</em>. Check the corresponding GitHub
repositories for their respective licenses.</p>
